Beats Studio Wireless Over-Ear Headphone - Matte Black,"View Larger View Larger View Larger The world’s most famous headphone has been completely redesigned and reimagined. The new Beats Studio is lighter, sexier, stronger, and more comfortable, with precision sound, Adaptive Noise Canceling, a 20-hour rechargeable battery, and RemoteTalk. It has all the energy and excitement you expect from Beats, plus a powerful, reengineered sound. Features Feel Your Music The Beats Acoustic Engine makes your listening experience intimate, personal, and real. Our signature DSP software is designed to generate the emotional experience that Dr. Dre, Jimmy Iovine, and some of the music industry’s greatest rock, hip-hop, pop, electronic, and R&B producers want you to feel. This is how music would sound if the artist could play it back for you in person. Put the World on Mute Silence the noise from your daily commute or the drama from your loud neighbors with our no-compromise dual-mode Adaptive Noise Canceling. When you’re listening to music, ANC automatically strikes a balance between your music and the world outside. If you only want to use the headphone to cancel external noise, the ANC-only mode automatically increases the level of noise cancellation to create a quieter world. What Batteries? Dead batteries can kill your vibe in a flash. The New Beats Studio fixes this with a 20-hour rechargeable battery. To prevent wasting energy, the Auto On/Off feature turns off the headphone when you unplug, and with the visible Battery Fuel Gauge, you always know how much juice is available. Forget specialized adapters; the New Studio can be charged via micro USB almost anywhere. Lighter, Stronger, and More Comfortable When we reimagined our legendary headphone, we designed it like a beautiful sports car and made disciplined choices. We streamlined the New Beats Studio with fast curves, smooth surfaces, and no visible screws. We shaved 13 percent off the original weight and gave it a lighter, stronger, and more comfortable headband. We created softer ear cups and an ergonomic bellow to create a flexible, custom fit for every head shape, so you can keep your music all to yourself.

KitSound KSDOODLEFX KitSound Doodle Children's Character 85Db Volume Limiting On Ear Headphones - Fox,"Introducing the KitSound Doodles Because your hearing is so precious, the KS Doodles headphones feature volume-limiting technology, to let you listen to your music without bursting your eardrums. Great Design Music doesn't have to be serious. Novelty records released by puppets and cartoon characters prove that, and our character headphones are fun too. Safe Listening Research has shown that listening to loud music over a long period of time can potentially lead to noise induced hearing loss (NIHL). These headphones have been engineered so that the level of sound being delivered to the ears does not exceed an average of 85 dB - which is the figure recommended by healthcare professionals. So you can have a great quality listening experience without having to crank the volume up to max. We don't want to sound like your parents, but sometimes music can be too loud. Please Note The 85 dB relates to headphone and music player combination. These headphones have been limited by impedance based on 60 mW output from iPod and higher than average music production values. It is however therefore theoretically possible in the short term to exceed this level using non standard audio equipment and playing a musical selection that may have been recorded at a significantly higher level. We recommend that as well as using the Doodles headphones, you should educate your child on safe and responsible listening. About KitSound We are craftspeople. We are musicians. We are KitSound and we all commit ourselves to achieving one shared goal: Bringing people closer to their music. By understanding music we stay true to its craft. Pure, rich, incredible sound. We settle for nothing less. Specifications: - Frequency response: 20 Hz - 20 kHz - Sensitivity: 85 dB - Drivers: 40 mm dynamic - DC input voltage: 0.178 V - Jack plug: 3.5 mm"

Beats Studio 2.0 Wired Over Ear Headphone - Blue,"View Larger View Larger View Larger The world’s most famous headphone has been completely redesigned and reimagined. The new Beats Studio is lighter, sexier, stronger, and more comfortable, with precision sound, Adaptive Noise Canceling, a 20-hour rechargeable battery, and RemoteTalk. It has all the energy and excitement you expect from Beats, plus a powerful, reengineered sound. Features Feel Your Music The Beats Acoustic Engine makes your listening experience intimate, personal, and real. Our signature DSP software is designed to generate the emotional experience that Dr. Dre, Jimmy Iovine, and some of the music industry’s greatest rock, hip-hop, pop, electronic, and R&B producers want you to feel. This is how music would sound if the artist could play it back for you in person. Put the World on Mute Silence the noise from your daily commute or the drama from your loud neighbors with our no-compromise dual-mode Adaptive Noise Canceling. When you’re listening to music, ANC automatically strikes a balance between your music and the world outside. If you only want to use the headphone to cancel external noise, the ANC-only mode automatically increases the level of noise cancellation to create a quieter world. What Batteries? Dead batteries can kill your vibe in a flash. The New Beats Studio fixes this with a 20-hour rechargeable battery. To prevent wasting energy, the Auto On/Off feature turns off the headphone when you unplug, and with the visible Battery Fuel Gauge, you always know how much juice is available. Forget specialized adapters; the New Studio can be charged via micro USB almost anywhere. Lighter, Stronger, and More Comfortable When we reimagined our legendary headphone, we designed it like a beautiful sports car and made disciplined choices. We streamlined the New Beats Studio with fast curves, smooth surfaces, and no visible screws. We shaved 13 percent off the original weight and gave it a lighter, stronger, and more comfortable headband. We created softer ear cups and an ergonomic bellow to create a flexible, custom fit for every head shape, so you can keep your music all to yourself.

Boasting premium-quality 50mm speakers, intuitively placed on-ear controls, and a detachable noise-canceling microphone, the F.R.E.Q. 7 transports you into the worlds of your favorite videogames. Providing balanced, directional audio and built from sturdy materials, the highly durable and extremely comfortable F.R.E.Q. 7 is the ultimate 7.1 surround sound gaming headset. Immersive 7.1 Surround Sound Powered by Dolby Headphone Technology A simple button press initiates Dolby Headphone and provides 7.1-channel surround sound – enhancing your directional awareness and creating a detailed, spacious 3D audio landscape which sounds as if it's beyond the limits of the headset. Hearing each and every disturbance within a game's environment gives you the competitive advantage by alerting you to the presence of your enemies long before they see you coming. Your game only supports stereo sound? No problem – Dolby Pro Logic IIx processing will up-mix stereo content to the surround sound channels to give you the edge over rivals who are only playing in stereo. And when you just want to listen to music in its originally recorded state, just toggle a button to disable Dolby Headphone and the F.R.E.Q. 7 will play your tunes in stereo.

Detachable Noise-canceling Microphone with Illuminated Mute Notification When not using to the mic to communicate with your online teammates, a headset's microphone only gets in the way. Problem solved with the Mad Catz F.R.E.Q. 7's removable solution – it provides the freedom to use the mic only when necessary. And when gaming in loud environments, the mic's advanced noise cancelation stifles ambient sounds to ensure your conversations are crystal-clear. Toggling the microphone mute button prevents your teammates from hearing anything you don't want them to, and red LED illumination in the tip of the detachable mic will never make you wonder whether or not they can hear you. Easy-to-Find On-Ear Controls Intuitive placement of all controls provides simple adjustability without the need to remove the headset. Mute the mic, tweak the volume, and toggle Dolby setting – all while keeping your eyes on your monitor. Intuitive Software Interface Easily accessed from the Windows system tray next to your clock, use the included software to quickly switch between the headset's three equalizer settings – Gaming, Music and Voice.
